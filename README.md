Works with VSCode, but won't with the majority of editors:

> If you try to test this by opening a text editor, adding some text and saving the file, you'll see that it may not work. The reason is that editors like Xcode don't actually modify the file -- instead, they act on copies of it. When you save it, they delete the original file and replace it with the copy they were maintaining. —[SwiftRocks](https://swiftrocks.com/dispatchsource-detecting-changes-in-files-and-folders-in-swift)
